# Squad Shuffler

Squad Shuffler is an application designed to shuffle players into teams. I created the game for my friends to make our game night more fun. The initial phase of this project was developed to cater to a specific gaming scenario 'SEQUENCE' where there can be a maximum of 12 players, with each team containing a maximum of 3 players. The application ensures an equal distribution of players among the teams. I used the algorithm Fisher-Yates on top of hashing algorithm to ensure shuffling. 

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Frontend:** HTML5 and CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js

## Shuffling Algorithm

Squad Shuffler employs the Fisher-Yates algorithm in conjunction with a hashing algorithm to ensure the randomness of the shuffling process. This guarantees a fair distribution of players into teams, enhancing the gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To use Squad Shuffler, visit the application at [Hannahjef.github.io](https://Hannahjef.github.io).

## Features

- Shuffle players into teams for games with specific player and team size constraints.
- Ensures equal distribution of players among teams.
- Enhances the gaming experience with a fair and randomized shuffling algorithm.

## How to Use the Application

1. Adjust Team Size: Use the provided buttons to adjust the team size according to the requirements of your game.

2. Add Player Names: Enter the names of the players who will participate in the game. You can add or remove player names as needed.

3. Assign Players to Teams: After entering the player names and adjusting the team size, click the "Assign" button to shuffle the players into teams.


## Future Changes

We have plans to make the following improvements to Squad Shuffler:

1. Generalize the Application: We aim to make the application versatile and adaptable for various games and team size constraints.

2. Game Constraints: We will provide a clear description of the constraints for the game, ensuring that the shuffling process aligns with the rules and requirements of the specific game.

3. Player List Upload: In a future update, we will introduce the ability to upload a list of player names, making it even more convenient to shuffle players into teams.
